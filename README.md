# Tesseract OCR

### Wonderful software
#### What i hope to do with it
- Scan images in mobile devices
- Use the optimized version of the tesseractOCR
- Scan the image, **convert it to text**
- Take the text and send it to my **telegram or email** (for multiple device access)
- Change the filter of the image, to manipulate it better for the background, and text quality
- Hopefully allow the user to choose a better filter, for dark conditions, bright and intermediate

### Wishes
- Be able to scan complicated formats/structure documents
- Reproduce the structure in text format
- In markdown or whatever the terminal uses
